She sits on a big golden key and picks it up in surprise. She tries it on all the doors but it does not fit. She weeps and weeps—and Wonderland grows dark to her in her despair. In the darkness she cries, “Oh! I’m slipping! Oh, Oh! it’s a lake; Oh! my tears! I’m floating!” A mysterious light shows a “Drink me” sign around a bottle on the top of the table.</em> Alice _floats up to it panting, and holding on to the edge of the table takes up the bottle._]</p><p>Alice</p><p>It isn’t marked poison.</p><p>[_She sips at it._]</p><p>This is good! Tastes like cherry tart, custard, pineapple, roast turkey, toffy and hot buttered toast—all together. Oh! Oh! I’m letting out like a telescope.</p><p>[_A mysterious light shows her lengthening out._]</p></div> </div>
